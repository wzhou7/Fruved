Scoring Instructions

Each of the BECS scales are scored by calculating the average of the summed item raw scores. 

Nutrition Changeability = (Item 27 + Item 28 + Item 29 + Item 30 + Item 31 + Item 32 + Item 33 + Item 34) / 8

Nutrition Behavior = (Item 1 + Item 2 + Item 3 + Item 4 + Item 8 + Item 9 + Item 10 + Item 11 + Item 12 + Item 13) / 10

Environmental Changeability = (Item 18 + Item 19 + Item 20 + Item 21 + Item 22 + Item 24 + Item 25 + Item 26) / 8

Program Importance and Changeability = (Item 15 + Item 16 + Item 23) / 3

Exercise Behavior= (Item 5 + Item 6 + Item 7) / 3

Sleep Behavior and Importance = (Item 14 + Item 17) / 2

Weight Loss = (Item 35 + Item 36 + Item 37) / 3

Alcohol Intake = (Item 38 + Item 39 + Item 40) / 3
