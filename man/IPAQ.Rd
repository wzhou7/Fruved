}
\description{
The function returns the stress score given the data. 

MET values and Formula for computation of Met-minutes

Walking MET-minutes/week = 3.3 * walking minutes * walking days

Moderate MET-minutes/week = 4.0 * moderate-intensity activity minutes * moderate days

Vigorous MET-minutes/week = 8.0 * vigorous-intensity activity minutes * vigorous-intensity days

\format{
  The data needs to name the survey variables as follows (the ordering does not matter): 
  \describe{
    \item{\code{IPAQ1}}{During the last 7 days, on how many days did you do vigorous physical activities like heavy lifting, digging, aerobics, or fast bicycling?}
    \item{\code{IPAQ2}}{How much time did you usually spend doing vigorous physical activities on one of those days?}
    \item{\code{IPAQ3}}{During the last 7 days, on how many days did you do moderate physical activities like carrying light loads, bicycling at a regular pace, or doubles tennis?Â  Do not include walking.}
    \item{\code{IPAQ4}}{How much time did you usually spend doing moderate physical activities on one of those days?}
    \item{\code{IPAQ5}}{During the last 7 days, on how many days did you walk for at least 10 minutes at a time?}
    \item{\code{IPAQ6}}{How much time did you usually spend walking on one of those days?}
