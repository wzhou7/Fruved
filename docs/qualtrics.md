# Downloading Data From Qualtrics

When exporting survey data from Qualtrics, we recommend using the plain text format using Tab delimiters. It is also important to ensure that you know whether you are using a coded value version or a choice text version. We recommend using the coded value version and it is your responsibility to ensure the correspondence between the coded values and the choice texts.
