The Healthy Campus Environmental Audit (HCEA) was a comprehensive series of objective assessments to determine the environmental supports for health promotion and obesity prevention. 
The audit included the most important evidence-based health promotion, food/dining, physical activity education, and infrastructure environmental factors that might influence consumer behavior. 
The HCEA evaluated cafeteria/restaurants, convenience store, vending, recreation programs/facilities, walkability/bike-ability, and initiatives and policies.
The HCEA was used to understand the full food, physical activity, and health promotion environment and to document existing health-facilitating campus environmental and policy supports. Each Audit was composed of approximately 15-25 items, with criterion scored using a five-point semantic-differential scale ranging from limited to extensive healthfulness or environmental support/evidence.  Each audit had been reviewed by experts, pilot-tested, and had acceptable Inter-rater reliability.\cite{HECA55,HECA56,HECA57,HECA58} 

A survey was created based on the Partnership for a Healthier America's (PHA) Healthier Campus Initiative (HCI) guidelines for campus. 
In the HCI, colleges partnering with PHA are asked to adopt at least `x` new policies (points) over a three-year time-period. 
These points were adapted into a survey and GetFruved college campus partners were asked to complete the surveys in the fall at the beginning of the school year and again at the end of the school year. 
Multiple individuals from the same school could participate in completing the survey as different individuals would have knowledge of different areas of health-related programs, efforts, and policies on campus.
